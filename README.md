#**About the dataset**

1.age

2.sex

3.chest pain type (4 values)

value 0: typical angina

value 1: atypical angina

value 2: non-anginal pain

value 3: asymptomatic

4.trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

5.chol: serum cholestrol in mg/dl

6.fbs: (fasting blood sugar> 120 mg/dl)(1 = true; 0 = false)

7.restecg: resting electrocardiographic results

value 0: normal

value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality(T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of> 0.05 mV)

value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

8.thalach: maximum heart rate achieved

9.exang: exercise induced angina (1=yes; 0=no)

10.oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

11.slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

value 1: upsloping

value 2: flat

value 3: downloping

12.ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

13.thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect

14.target: 0=less chance of heart attack, 1 = more chance of heart attack
