2.**Correlation Matrix- Heatmap**

  A correlation matrix is a statistical technique used to evaluate the relationship between two variables in a data set. The matrix is a table in which every cell contains a correlation coefficient, where 1 is considered a strong relationship between variables, 0 a neutral relationship and -1 a not strong relationship.

#**Logistic Regression Classifier**

  Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm, used to classify elements of a set into two groups (binary classification) by calculating the probability of each element of the set Logistic Regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable has a binary solution, we predict the values of categorical variables.

  **Accuracy** of the Logistic Regression classifier is about **88%**

#**Decision Tree Classifier**

   **Accuracy** of the Decision Tree classifier is about **97%.**

     Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm, used to classify elements of a set into two groups (binary classification) by calculating the probability of each element of the set Logistic Regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable has a binary solution, we predict the values of categorical variables.

 #**Random forest classifier**

   Random Forest is a robust machine learning algorithm that can be used for a variety of tasks including regression and classification. It is an ensemble method, meaning that a random forest model is made up of a large number of small decision trees, called estimators, which each produce their own predictions. The random forest model combines the predictions of the estimators to produce a more accurate prediction.

   **Accuracy** of the Random Forest classifier is about **86%.**

 #**Support Vector Machines**

   It is a supervised machine learning problem where we try to find a hyperplane that best separates the two classes. Note: Donâ€™t get confused between SVM and logistic regression. Both the algorithms try to find the best hyperplane, but the main difference is logistic regression is a probabilistic approach whereas support vector machine is based on statistical approaches.

   **Accuracy** of the Support Vector Machines is about **87%.**
